# thesis repository

Most figures in my thesis can be reproduced using this repository. Exceptions are figures made in  PyMOL (a molecule viewer, used to visualise protein structures), some figures with computationally intensive data analysis included in their generation and figures provided by collaborators.

The repository has three different folders, one for each thesis chapter.
