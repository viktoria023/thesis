# thesis repository

Most figures in my thesis can be reproduced using this repository. Exceptions are figures made in  PyMOL (a molecule viewer, used to visualise protein structures) and figures provided by collaborators.

The repository has three different folders, one for each thesis chapter. 

To reproduce the figures, click the corresponding button next to the chapter titles below:
